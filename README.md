🚀 Laser-Guided Robot

A robotics project that uses laser detection, sensors, and microcontroller logic to track a laser dot and navigate toward it. Designed as a learning project in electronics, sensors, and programming.

📌 Features

🔦 Laser Target Tracking – Detects the position of a laser dot using photodiodes or light sensors.

📡 Real-Time Position Feedback – Reads sensor values and calculates target direction.

⚙️ Motor Control System – Drives motors to follow the laser pointer.

🧠 Microcontroller Logic – Uses Arduino-compatible code (or similar) to react to sensor input.

I will be adding more detail as the project progresses.
